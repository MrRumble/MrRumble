## Projects

### [Current Project: News Sentiment Analyzer](https://github.com/MrRumble/SentimentPress)
I am currently working on a collaborative group project to develop a full-stack application using the NewsAPI. This application provides users with insightful news summaries by analyzing the sentiment of related news articles. 

- **Backend:** Built in Python, handles sentiment analysis and interacts with the NewsAPI to fetch relevant articles.
- **Frontend:** Developed with JavaScript and React, displaying the top three and bottom three articles based on sentiment analysis.
- **Database:** MongoDB is used to store search queries and results to track trends over time.
- **Local Storage:** Redis is utilized for blacklisting expired JWT tokens as a security measure, with plans to extend its use for storing cookies and tracking user interactions to enhance personalization.
- **User Features:** Includes secure sign-up and user authentication features to ensure a safe and personalized experience.
- **Future Work:** Developing and deploying our own API to support app functionalities and ensure a scalable architecture.
