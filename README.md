Hello! I'm a passionate tech enthusiast currently transitioning into the tech industry. Iâ€™m excited about leveraging my technical skills, strong communication abilities, and enthusiasm for technology in new and innovative ways. 

Feel free to connect with me or check out my projects to see the work Iâ€™ve been passionate about!

## Projects

### [SentimentPress](https://github.com/MrRumble/SentimentPressV2)

Check it out here! http://sentimentpress-frontend-1.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/

As someone passionate about tech and current affairs, I wanted to build a tool that offers a clearer lens on how different topics are portrayed in the media. **SentimentPress** is a full-stack web app designed to fetch and process real-time news articles and visualise their sentiment trends using powerful NLP models.

Using NewsAPI, the app retrieves article metadata (titles, descriptions, sources) and runs sentiment analysis with a Transformer-based model to score each article as positive or negative. It then summarises standout articles and provides users with a clean, interactive dashboard to explore media tone around a search topic.

This project has been a deep dive into natural language processing, backend pipelines, data handling, and full deployment.

Explore the app to see how modern machine learning tools can turn raw news data into digestible insights.

- **Backend:** Flask (Python) serving RESTful APIs and orchestrating data processing and analysis pipelines.
- **Frontend:** React.js for dynamic, user-friendly data visualisation and search functionality.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for storing articles, sentiment scores, and summaries in a structured format.
- **NLP Models:** Hugging Faceâ€™s `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english` (sentiment) and `distilbart-cnn-12-6` (summarisation).
- **Deployment:** Fully containerised with Docker and hosted on an AWS EC2 instance.
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Workflows with `pytest` for continuous integration and backend test coverage.

### [Current Project: Wedding Band Song Request App](https://github.com/MrRumble/Function-Band-Request-a-Song-App)
As a guitarist in a wedding and function band, Iâ€™ve experienced firsthand the challenges of managing song requests during live performances. Often, these requests come through word of mouth, which can be chaotic and disruptive to the flow of the event. To tackle this issue and enhance the guest experience, Iâ€™m developing the Wedding Band Song Request App.

This innovative application allows guests to seamlessly submit their song requests by scanning a QR code at the event. By digitising the request process, the app streamlines communication between guests and the band, making it easier to manage and fulfil requests without interrupting the performance.

The goal of this project is to create a more interactive and enjoyable experience for everyone involved, ensuring that guests can easily contribute to the playlist while the band remains focused on delivering an unforgettable performance.

Explore the project to see how technology can enhance live events and simplify song requests!

- **Backend:** Flask (Python) for handling API requests and managing application logic.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for storing user data, song requests, event details, and more.
- **Frontend:** React.js for building an interactive and responsive user interface.
- **Authentication:** OAuth2 for secure and streamlined user authentication and authorisation.
